We tried to ship an X server once that only supported a 24bit<br />
TrueColor visual. The main problems we encountered were:<br />
	1) Clients written with logic like the following:<br />
	    if (DefaultDepth() != 1)<br />
		/* Assume default depth is 8bit */<br />
	   These clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window<br />
	   to run correctly.<br />
	2) Other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just<br />
	   outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a<br />
	   dynamic colormap. XStoreColors doesn't work on cmaps<br />
	   associated with Static or TrueColor visual classes, but<br />
	   many clients don't bother to check, they just start<br />
	   throwing XStoreColor calls at you.<br />
Though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many<br />
clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit PseudoColor as a<br />
default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client<br />
writers to change their clients to do the right thing.<br />

Subject: 24-bit Static color: will clients like it?<br />
I'm writing an X server for some video-generation equipment.  The<br />
hardware is "truecolor" in YUV space; in X terms it has a 24-bit<br />
static color visual.  I would really like to have the server just<br />
present this static visual, but I'm not sure if this will be <br />
acceptable to "most" X clients.  The three problems I see are:<br />
  1) The colormap, though huge, is static.<br />
  2) All pixels would be 3 bytes wide.<br />
  3) Because the hardware actually lives in YUV space, the<br />
     translation RGB->YUV will introduce some rounding error.<br />
Being more of a server guy than a client guy, I ask: will these<br />
limitations thwart many X clients?  Or will most of the X stuff<br />
floating around blithely accept what they're given?  I could write<br />
the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, <br />
but I'd rather avoid this if not necessary.<br />
I know there are no absolutes, but I'd appreciate hearing people's<br />
opinions and suggestions.  Thanks!<br />

But, but, but... How does buying an external modem solve the problem<br />
of wanting more than 2 serial devices at once?  And since the PC<br />
only supports two, why are you blaming a modem vendor for the<br />
problem?  I don't see how your experience could have been different<br />
with any internal modem. <br />

Subject: *** CONSUMER WARNING ***  MidWest Micro (Ohio)<br />
Thinking of buying from MidWest Micro of Ohio? Think *very* carefully.<br />
Unless you are absolutely sure you won't have any problems, you may want<br />
to trade elsewhere.<br />
Despite the fact that they answer the phone, "Hi! I'm <whoever> and we're<br />
having a GREAT Day!", they weren't quite so happy when I wanted to return<br />
a modem that didn't work as I expected it to.<br />
The details:<br />
I ordered one of their house brand "Infotel" 14.4/DF internal FAX modems.<br />
In reality, it was a Twincom Lightning FAX that had a paper sticker over<br />
the name. Given the poor reports on the net about this modem, I would not<br />
have ordered it, had I known this in advance.<br />
It arrived on time. The documentation stated that it would work (and was<br />
preconfigured) as COM4, providing that COM2 was not in use at the same time.<br />
For several reasons, I have a serial card configured for COM1/COM2. At the<br />
time I installed the modem, nothing was connected to COM2.<br />
Although the modem appeared to work, during every connection at 9600 or<br />
14.4, it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. After<br />
spending some time on the phone with MidWest's tech support, they suggested<br />
disabling the COM2 port.<br />
This appeared to solve the disconnect problem, but was an unacceptable long<br />
term solution. I had to have COM1 and 2 available, even though they both<br />
would not be in use at the same time as the modem.<br />
I called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in Voicemail <br />
hell, listening to repeated advertisements for MidWest Micro products. I <br />
was then promptly disconnected. Apparently it was quiting time and they <br />
didn't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.<br />
I called the next day and asked the Customer Diservice agent for an RMA<br />
number. She promptly switched me to a "Tech Support" rep that implied that<br />
it was my equipment at fault and that he wasn't going to give me an RMA<br />
number. He suggested I use some nonstandard IRQ settings, a solution I<br />
was not happy with. The modem should work as originally configured.<br />
Conclusion:<br />
I'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system, but it clearly does<br />
not work in a multi port system like mine. Since my time is worth more <br />
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem, I gave it to a local<br />
charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered<br />
a Practical Peripherals 14.4MT from PC Connection.<br />
For $30 more, I have a solid external modem built by a company I know <br />
will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal<br />
experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. I should have<br />
known better...<br />

Now my comments: <br />
I'd like to add that some of the "protests" do not come from a strictly <br />
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for <br />
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I <br />
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may <br />
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - <br />
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars <br />
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and <br />
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time <br />
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. <br />
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  <br />
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there <br />
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief <br />
in an afterlife.  <br />
The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks <br />
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light <br />
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people <br />
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating <br />
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or <br />
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  <br />
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. <br />
Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live <br />
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport <br />
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The <br />
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists <br />
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped <br />
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life <br />
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels <br />
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains <br />
one weekend, "getting away from it all" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, <br />
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed <br />
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 <br />
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters <br />
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of <br />
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. <br />
But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't <br />
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - <br />
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch <br />
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, <br />
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  <br />
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at <br />
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last<br />
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  <br />
To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage <br />
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at <br />
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the <br />
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it <br />
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could <br />
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky <br />
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that <br />
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, <br />
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. <br />

My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but <br />
got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering <br />
the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO <br />
inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive <br />
of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out <br />

rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) <br />

There are two approaches:<br />
1. If your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the<br />
monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go<br />
from the monitor to the back of the computer.<br />
2. You can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing<br />
power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the<br />
computer.<br />
Both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer<br />
stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at<br />
good prices). Power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking<br />
for some special thing at a Mac store.<br />

Subject: Where to get power cord to plug Non-Apple monitor into Quadra power supply?<br />
I have a Sony 1304s whch I would like to hook up so that I get its <br />
power though my Quadra 800's power supply. ie, if I had an apple monitor,<br />
I could plug the monitor directly into the computer so that when I hit<br />
the power button the keyboard, both the monitor and computer go on, and<br />
when I shut down, both go off.  Is there an extension cord type cable<br />
I can buy which allows me to plug my existing power cord into and then plug<br />
this "extension cable" into my Quadra?<br />
Any thoughts and comments would be appreciated,<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark<br />
recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view<br />
given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'<br />
is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.<br />
I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider<br />
themselves such.  Following is the definition from "Jargon File 2.9.10".<br />
(This is also known as the "Hackers Dictionary".)  The definitions are<br />
arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:<br />
   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.<br />
     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable<br />
     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most<br />
     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who<br />
     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys<br />
     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A<br />
     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is<br />
     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,<br />
     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX<br />
     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who<br />
     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One<br />
     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the<br />
     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing<br />
     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to<br />
     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password<br />
     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.<br />
     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global<br />
     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and<br />
     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described<br />
     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see<br />
     {hacker ethic, the}).<br />
     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe<br />
     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an<br />
     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new<br />
     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego<br />
     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if<br />
     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled<br />
     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.<br />
   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing<br />
     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of<br />
     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and<br />
     facilitating access to information and to computing resources<br />
     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun<br />
     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits<br />
     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.<br />
     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no<br />
     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe<br />
     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and<br />
     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that<br />
     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary<br />
     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}<br />
     project.<br />
     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of<br />
     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.<br />
     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who<br />
     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On<br />
     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy<br />
     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,<br />
     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it<br />
     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an<br />
     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.<br />
     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker<br />
     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share<br />
     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing<br />
     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as<br />
     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})<br />
     can function without central control because of this trait; they<br />
     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be<br />
     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.<br />
:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is<br />
:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.<br />
: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who<br />
: says "Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)<br />
Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing<br />
limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better<br />
not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,<br />
in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary<br />
to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the<br />
workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known<br />
and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.<br />
: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.<br />
:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)<br />
Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is<br />
to communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place,<br />
then language is working.<br />

The PowerBook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.  Nor does the 140.<br />
The Mac Portable had one, and I think the PowerBook 100 had one.  I don't<br />

   I have tested this on a 230 and it does work there.  So it would<br />
seem that the 140 and 170 are out though.  One way to tell is to<br />
go and open the PowerBook control panel(7.1).  There is a setting<br />
there that allows you to set the time to wake up the Mac.  If it<br />

It is used to create a TIN (triangulated irregular network), which is<br />
basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of<br />
points.  What is special about it is that the triangles formed are the <br />
most equalateral possible.  Check out "Proceedings of AutoCarto N" where<br />
N is 8..10.  Sorry, I don't have a specific reference describing the<br />
process.<br />

Picture our universe floating like a log<br />

river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the<br />

occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the<br />

translaions occur.  The distribution of damage to<br />
the log depends on the shape of the log.<br />

Actually, the 295 is for the 33 MHz PowerCard, not the Universal Powercache.<br />
The 33 MHz Universal Powercache with FPU and adaptor can be had for about<br />
$500 (still not a bad deal).  I believe the Powercard is one generation <br />
older than the Universal Powercache, and the one primary difference is that<br />
the Powercard is machine specific while the Powercache can fit into many<br />
Macs with the proper adaptor.  Both cards are 68030 based.<br />
I'm not sure if the hardware or software with the Powercard is otherwise <br />
different from the Powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me?).<br />
I would also add that I called River Computer the other night and these<br />
Powercards were going very fast.<br />
