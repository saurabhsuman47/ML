The project is about predicting volatility of company stocks using regression. 

It uses the following dataset for training and testing: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/regression/E2006.train.bz2
The dataset has been generated by mining the reports on Form 10-k that companies filed with SEC(Securities and Exchange Commission).
There are 16,087 examples available. There are 150,360 features, corresponding to different words in reports.

The dataset is different in the sense that it contains more features than samples.
Mathematically speaking this system has more variables than equations (Underdetermined system).Such a system can have infinitely many solutions.
If regularization is not used, then we may find models with 100% training accuracy but they will generalize rather poorly (overfitting).
So it is necessary to use regularization in this case.


Main.py loads the data and uses it to train Linear Regression Model(available in sklearn.linear_model).<br/>
The model is trained using KFold cross-validation.
The results are following(without regularization):

* Train R2 score = 0.99999261654 (overfitting - will not generalize well)
* Test R2 score = -0.129615667613

For regularization ElasitcNet has been used (available from sklearn.linear_model).
ElasticNet is a Linear regression model with combined L1 and L2 priors as regularizer.
The penalty term is: a * L1 + b * L2 where: alpha = a + b and l1_ratio = a / (a + b)
There is significant improvement in R2 scores (using alpha = 0.1, l1_ratio = 0.5)

* Train R2 score = 0.606471796547
* Test R2 score = 0.606507736107

Tuning the hyperparameters: 
For finding the optimum alpha and l1_ratio ElasitcNetCV has been used. It takes a list of l1_ratios as parameter and calculates a list of alphas for each l1_ratio. And for each (alpha, l1_ratio) value it trains and tests the model storing the pair that give optimum R2 score.
l1_ratio = [.5, .9, .95, 1.0] (Since the input is very sparse, L1 penalty is preferred)
Results:
* Train R2 score = 0.653843711527
* Test R2 score = 0.653738364217
* clf.alpha_ = 0.000303368283226
* clf.l1_ratio_ = 1.0

Finally, actual values vs predicted values curves have been plotted.
