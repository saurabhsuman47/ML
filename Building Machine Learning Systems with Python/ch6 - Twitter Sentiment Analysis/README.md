The project is about sentiment analysis of twitter data. 

The goal is to build a simple sentiment classifier of tweets.(ie classify tweets as negative or positive).

It uses the dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zfz/twitter_corpus/master/full-corpus.csv for traing and testing.

It uses a pipeline of tfidf vectorizer and naive bayes classifier as estimator.

For finding the best parameters for the estimator GridSearchCV has been used.
